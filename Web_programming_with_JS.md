## Lesson 8: Syntax:


* Hoisting is a result of how JS is interpreted in the browser. Essantially, before any JS code is executed all variables are hoisted which means they are raised to the top of the fct scope.
* Variables declared with `let` and `const` eliminate the hoisting issue because they are scoped to the block and not to the function (when using `var`, variables are either scoped *globally* or *locally*.
* __Rules for using let and const__ : Use `let` when you are planning to change the value of the variable later in the code.
* Template literals.
* Destructure. 
* Object Literal Shorthand.
* For .... of loop 
* Spread Operator
* Rest Parameter 

### Lesson 9: Shell Workshop:


* commands reviewed in this lesson are: `pwd` print working directory, `cd` change directory, `cd ..` change to the parent directory, `mv` move file, `mkdir` make directory, `rm` remove file, `rmdir` remove directory, `curl` downloading, `less` viewing files in the shell, `cat` reads the file and output the content (runs several things together), `ls` list directory, `ls-l` list it with parameters, `grep` searching and pipes, `grep -c` searching the count of ... , `echo` print to the shell, `$` Set it to a variable in the shell

### Lesson 10: Version Control:

* `git status`, `git init`, `git clone`, `git push`, `git push`, `git commit`, `git log`, `git log --oneline`,  `git log --stat`, `git show`, `git log -p`
